					<h4>ENGCMP 0208 Seminar in Comp: Service-Learning</h4>
					<p class="lead">Several sections of Seminar in Composition: Service-Learning (ENGCMP 0208) are offered in the fall and spring terms. Students in this section of SC will engage in service-learning, pairing meaningful service in the community with the academic work for the course. Throughout the term, the students provide service with community nonprofits of their choice; students can expect to devote about 2-3 hours a week, for a total of thirty hours of service over the course of the term. Class discussions focus on their experiences during this service work as well as their reflections on this experience as guided by a sequence of critical readings and short essay assignments. By considering the subjects in this community context, the course improves students’ essay writing by helping them to become more critical readers and writers.
					</p>

				<div class="row" id="FP0003">
					<h4>ENGCMP 0212 Seminar in Comp: Topics in Diversity</h4>
					<p class="lead">Seminar in Composition is a course taken by almost all undergraduates at the University of Pittsburgh. Its goals are to help you engage in writing as a creative, disciplined form of critical inquiry; compose thoughtfully crafted essays that position your ideas among other views; write with precision, nuance, and awareness of textual conventions; and revise your writing by rethinking the assumptions, aims, and effects of prior drafts. This seminar will include readings and writing activities that explore concepts and practices relating to diversity and its established and emerging definitions.
					</p>

				<div class="row" id="FP0006">
					<h4>FP 0003 First-Year Seminar</h4>
					<p class="lead">First-Year Seminar fulfills the Seminar in Composition requirement and includes Academic Foundations (FP 0001).  Due to this, additional meetings and activities will occur outside of scheduled class times.  Academic Foundations is designed especially for first-term students as an introduction to the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. Through class work and out-of-class activities, students will gain knowledge of the educational opportunities at the University, the cultural events on and off campus, and an understanding of what it means to be a liberal arts student.  All students who enroll in this course will receive a free academic planner on the first day of class.

					<h2>Core Courses</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="row" id="ENGCMP0420">
					<h4>ENGCMP 0420 Writing for the Public</h4>
					<p class="lead">This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals; press kits; editorials; informational Web sites; articles; and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row" id="ENGCMP0560">
					<h4>ENGCMP 0560 Writing Arguments</h4>
					<p class="lead">This course has two goals: to help students become more adept at understanding and critically analyzing arguments, and to help students become better arguers themselves. Students in "Writing Arguments" will practice composing arguments across a variety of forms, genres, and technologies (written, visual, oral, digital) in order to develop and hone their persuasive language skills. As part of this practice, students will have the opportunity to design and participate in written and oral debates on topics of present interest and to compose their own examples of public persuasive communication. Writing Arguments would be especially appropriate for students headed to law or graduate school.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row" id="ENGCMP1900">
					<h4>ENGCMP 1900 PPW Internship</h4>
					<p class="lead">This internship is intended for juniors and seniors who are pursuing the public and professional writing certificate. The internship is designed to give students a productive, substantive writing experience where they will learn from and contribute to the sponsoring agency or project. Students will consult with an advisor to arrange for intern ships and to construct the plan of work, writing, and over sight.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row" id="ENGCMP1901">
					<h4>ENGCMP 1901 UTA: Teaching or Tutoring Writing</h4>
					<p class="lead">This experience is intended for students who wish to engage with the theory and practice of teaching writing under the mentorship of an English department faculty member. The undergraduate teaching assistantship is designed to give students a productive, substantive experience in which they will learn from and contribute to students' learning in a classroom or in the writing center. Students will consult with a faculty mentor to arrange the undergraduate teaching assistantship and to construct the plan of work, writing, and supervision.

				<div class="row" id="ENGCMP1099">
					<h4>ENGCMP 1099 The Language of Policy and Power: Topics in Diversity</h4>
					<p class="lead">This course invites students to deepen and expand their understanding of public policy writing and to build the skills necessary to address the unequal distribution of power and privilege influencing policy in the public sphere. The course provides students with the opportunity to develop a portfolio of practical and analytical policy-related writing by grounding our work in current discussions about diversity (including race, gender, LGBT+, ethnicity, ability, religion, and class). In this writing-intensive class, students will write a variety of documents, such as a history memo, a set of responses to the readings, a letter of public comment, an op-ed, a polemical essay, and a final policy memo, related to a specific and properly-scaled diversity policy issue. The course will address the specialized use of language, conventions and formats, premises, motives, and purposes related to policy documents and arguments in light of diversity. By preparing both reflective academic and professional policy documents, students will master not only the basics of policy writing, but, through their own research and writing, the rhetorical and critical thinking skills necessary to create effective policy. Students will learn to employ methods of inquiry, analysis, and composition characteristic of written and oral policy discussions as they relate to diversity questions, concerns, and legal requirements. We will read broadly and deeply, and engaged, informed class discussion responding to reading and current policy questions is a cornerstone of the class. We will explore how the explicit and implicit history and applications of public and private policies have created long-standing outcomes that are often taken for granted, and address ways to change and improve those outcomes.

				<div class="row" id="ENGCMP1100">
					<h4>ENGCMP 1100 Language of Business & Industry</h4>
                    <p class="lead">Companies want your attention. You are a consumer of products and services. You represent a prospective employee. You could become a shareholder. So companies reach out to you through advertising, annual reports, blogs, brochures, newsletters, podcasts, promotions, and websites, among other means. And as companies are seeking your attention, they can’t ignore other audiences—current employees, investors, government officials, and the media, for example—who are critical to their success. Companies have plenty to talk about—-their brand, vision, values, new products or services, job openings, employment benefits, financial results, social responsibility efforts—depending on who is listening. In this class, you will examine how companies create their identity through language. You will actively explore five “languages”: employment, marketing, culture, results, and social responsibility. You will study good business writing and apply these techniques in several writing assignments. For example, you will produce a report analyzing the employment brand of two companies where you would like to work after graduation.

                    <h4>ENGCOMP 1102 Language of Medicine</h4>
                    <p class="lead">This course will explore ways that language and communication patterns affect perceptions, dynamics, and outcomes in health and medical contexts. A blend of theory and narrative analysis, the course will review developments in the emerging field of medical rhetoric as the foundation for an interdisciplinary inquiry into the role of language in shaping our understandings of issues like health equity, pharmaceutical marketing, medical education and training, the “health care crisis,” patient-centered communication models, and the meanings of pain, death, illness and disability. The course will also provide an overview of how our linguistic models and arguments about health, illness, medicine, and the human body have changed over time, and we will explore some of the ways in which these arguments and models also vary by culture, ethnicity, gender, class and other social factors. Foundational terms of rhetorical analysis will be introduced—such as metaphors, terminisitic screens, constructed audiences, and transactional theories of persuasion—and a variety of theoretical essays, medical narratives, professional documents, and other relevant rhetorical artifacts will be read and discussed. Our discussions will also be informed by methods and reference points from some related disciplines, including linguistics, ethnography, and phenomenology. Several shorter writing assignments will be assigned, as well as a final paper investigating a medical rhetoric and health humanities question. Students intending to apply to health science graduate and professional schools will benefit from the course’s close attention to language, and its investigation of professional ethos will help them write better personal statements for application essays and become more effective communicators. Writing and communication majors will be able to add their projects to their professional portfolios to showcase familiarity with medical terms and issues, and to demonstrate sophisticated skills in research, analysis, and presentation. However, this course welcomes students from all majors and is appropriate for anyone who is interested in engaging with challenging readings about medical language and who is willing to develop informed, thoughtful views on the meanings and motives hidden in the ways we talk about health.

But how do history and ethics intersect to inform our decisions as writers? How do we serve the roles of advertiser and PR specialist simultaneously? What do the answers of these questions look like in the context of a real-world campaign? In this course, students will learn how pivotal ethical moments in advertising and PR history changed the face of these professions and influence our creative choices even now. Students will use the four-step planning process of research, strategy, implementation, and evaluation to construct innovative campaigns and tackle common ethical issues these professions face today. Topics to be explored may include manipulation and misrepresentation of facts, privacy concerns in the technology age, sensitivity to diversity and appropriation, responsible interaction with vulnerable populations, subliminal messaging tactics, and more. By the end of this course, students will produce a multi-faceted PR and advertising campaign that navigates a complex ethical issue and showcases their professional writing skills.

This class focuses on the writing that supports development work and teaches you the landscape of development work today. We will study real-world examples from both local and national nonprofits. You can expect to identify an organization to write for this term and to create a series of documents (in various forms) that will constitute your development portfolio by the end of the term. Some Pitt alumni who work in or run development offices will visit class to talk about their experiences.

The term "research" refers to substantially different activities in different professional settings. We will spend time looking at three particular types of research: literary journalism devoted to creating social change; research-based projects that attempt to create change in corporate practices such as management, customer relationships, and ethics; and documentary work that is designed to raise awareness, provoke conversation, and honor human and humane activity. All three of these areas yield many long and short projects—books and articles and scripts—that are created in the hope that the final product will have a real impact in the world. You will study some examples of research as it plays out in several books, articles, and a film documentary, and you'll plan and carry out a research project of your own.

                        Most of us probably assume that literacy is necessary in order to live a productive and happy life in the modern world. Learning how to read and write is "basic," right? But what is meant by writing and reading? What behaviors, knowledges, technological know-how, or skills are or have been included within those terms? And in what sense "necessary"--for whom or in what ways? What use, in other words, has been made of literacy and what values have been assigned to such use in personal, social, political and historical terms? What's literacy good for? In this course we will consider multiple literacies as complex social practices that vary according to time and place-- contested literacies, only some of which are or have been typically acquired through formal schooling. Our aim will be to challenge commonplace assumptions about the "proper" uses and values of literacy in order to think creatively and productively about educational, political, and personal alternatives. This course is designed especially for students planning on careers in teaching-related fields.
